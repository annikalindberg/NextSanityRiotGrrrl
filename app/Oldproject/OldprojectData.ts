      'Our final project at Technigo, where I, together with Irupé Pozo Graviz, came up with an idea how to address a problem we experienced when trying to address the gaps of representation and diversity within the tech industry. Specifically, we saw a lack of digital platforms aimed at connecting women and non-binary individuals within the tech community, particularly those from underrepresented groups or those new to the field. To bridge this gap, we developed a platform that enables users to find and connect with others based on mutual interests, experiences, and preferences. Imagine a Tinder designed for global tech talent, facilitating connections for mentorship, support, and shared experiences.',

    notes:
      "Although our ambitions for teQueenMatch exceeded the three- week scope of the Technigo bootcamp, we chose to fully commit to the project during this period and to continue development afterward.This decision was driven partly by our affinity for challenges that push us beyond our limits.We're both dedicated to the learning process and were seeking an engaging project to work on post-bootcamp. However, the primary driver was our strong belief in the idea's merit and its potential value to the community.This commitment led us to invest heavily in the project, even if it meant facing developmental delays.I won't sugarcoat it; the journey was fraught with challenges, but we persevered because we truly believe the platform is essential—not just for us, but for anyone in a similar position. Notes about the project. Currently, our server is deployed on Render. While it serves our needs, we acknowledge that it might not be the most efficient option for our project's demands. We are actively exploring other hosting platforms to enhance server performance.",

      "We're committed to improving TechConnect continuously. Here are some areas we're focusing on: Code Refactoring: We recognize the need for code refactoring and will continue to enhance code quality. User Experience: We plan to implement loaders in appropriate places to enhance the user experience. Middleware Handling: We're working to gracefully handle middleware and ensure smoother operation.",

      "Freelance job building a company web page for DoulaSkapet, a doulateam based in Stockholm, Sweden. This webpage is built bottom to top by me, including the designs, logos and content, domain-set up and SEO-optimization. I used Create React App as a starter and React Router for navigation. MUI Material is the library I used for component styling together with useTheme for customization. The design is made by me, and so is the logos and UX/UI. Im using React Helmet for SEO and Google Analytics for tracking and monitoring. I have been struggling quite a bit with utilizing GA to it's fullest using React Routing. Why I am currently looking into migrating to Next JS and utilize server side rendering and utilizing optimization benefits of SSR. The page is hosted on Netlify using a custom domain.",

    description:
      "This project was part of a code challenge where I was instructed to build a diary app. The app allows users to view, sort, and paginate diary entries, and features a professional UI thanks to Material-UI and Styled-components. Designed for scalability and extensibility, it's also pre-configured for API integration. Moving forward, I think it would be really fun to also integrate a server-side rendering, by building a backend API to store the data. Since I am a huge fan of Bullet Journal, further integrations that might be happening is features like local media like images, screenshots and customizable icons and doodles in addition to building on the filtering feature to be more advanced.",

      "I initiated this project as an assignment from one of my mentors, who requested a Hangman game implementation. To infuse creativity, I tweaked the UI changing the theme to make it suitable for kids to practice Swedish and/ or English words. This way, players with basic knowledge of these languages can enjoy the game. Ive continued this challenge after feedback and iterations together with my mentors. Since deploying the app I've made some refactoring of the code.I´ve also changed the rendering method from using mock- data to fetching from a real API.Implementing the changes will require some overall theme changes and tweaks to match the logics of the game theme.",
