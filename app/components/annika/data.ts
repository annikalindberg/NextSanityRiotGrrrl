    notes:
      "Although our ambitions for teQueenMatch exceeded the three- week scope of the Technigo bootcamp, we chose to fully commit to the project during this period and to continue development afterward.This decision was driven partly by our affinity for challenges that push us beyond our limits.We're both dedicated to the learning process and were seeking an engaging project to work on post-bootcamp. However, the primary driver was our strong belief in the idea's merit and its potential value to the community.This commitment led us to invest heavily in the project, even if it meant facing developmental delays.I won't sugarcoat it; the journey was fraught with challenges, but we persevered because we truly believe the platform is essentialâ€”not just for us, but for anyone in a similar position. Notes about the project. Currently, our server is deployed on Render. While it serves our needs, we acknowledge that it might not be the most efficient option for our project's demands. We are actively exploring other hosting platforms to enhance server performance.",

      "We're committed to improving TechConnect continuously. Here are some areas we're focusing on: Code Refactoring: We recognize the need for code refactoring and will continue to enhance code quality. User Experience: We plan to implement loaders in appropriate places to enhance the user experience. Middleware Handling: We're working to gracefully handle middleware and ensure smoother operation.",
