        In 2020, I transitionend from a career as a executive coordinator into
        web development, and I havent looked back since. 2023 I decided to
        enroll Technigo bootcamp and leverage my skills into the leading
        technologies on the market. After graduation I started building on my
        portfolio, my tech stack, and my passion for code.{' '}

          My background in education and accessibility compliance, has provided
          me with a deep understanding for web accessibility as a developer. I
          keep investing in my interest and earned several certificates within
          web accessibility standards and UX-design. In my freelance developer
          toolkit I provide accessibility audits as well as hands-on tips in how
          to improve code and UX/UI to be compliant to WCAG and WAI-ARIA
          standards.

          Speaking about tech.. React, Next.js, Node.js, and MongoDB is where I
          find myself most of the time. TypeScript/JavaScript is my first coding
          language. I naturally expand my tech stack based on the specific
          problems I need to solve with my code. My primary focus is always on
          the end user and the future maintainers of the code. I honor{' '}
          <span className="font-bold">best practices</span> to ensure a positive
          experience for both developers and end user. I love combining my
          interest in the latest design trends, keep playfulness and innovative
          edge yet making sure the design is accessible for anyone to use.
